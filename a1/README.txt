How to use:
Part 1:
Use WASD to move the Orb around. The Orb movement sensitivity is adjusted to test better.
Move Orb towards Armadillo to deform it. The deformation is most obvious near the face. 

Part 2:
Feature extensions:
1. Made showcasing the light physics and deformation easier with a ghost-like sphere movement so no need for keyboard micro adjusting
    Hover the orb near Armadillo's face for best results!
2. Also added a GUI setting to make the changes to the sphere's lighting. If the control is too small, press Cmd and + or Crtl and +
3. Added lots of graves semi-randomly using BoxGeometry to make the scene look scary.
4. Added some ghost-like lights that go around the Armadillo
